## R Project Folder Structures

Many programming languages and frameworks use folder structures for configuration and 
extensibility. To not use a standard would mean reinventing the wheel each time and 
risk confusing/slowing down collaborators. This problem has been tackled by many 
individuals in the R community. Based on their suggestions I have adapted the following 
structure to be quick and easy to use: 

<center>
  <img src="./img/folder-structure.png" />
</center><br>

The key features of this structure is that you physically separate the inputs, 
intermediate data, and outputs into three different folders: 

 1. `data`: Folder for put raw, unprocessed data
 2. `cache`: Folder for intermediate data, if needed
 3. `output`: Folder for cleaned data, plots, etc.
 
There are two remaining folders in the structure: 

 4. `docs`: Folder for supporting articles, explanations, and other documentation
 5. `R`: Folder for R scripts that hold global settings or functions if needed
 
In the top level are your analytical R scripts. Oftentimes these scripts can be 
long and complicated. I recommend breaking up any sequential steps into smaller 
files that numbered so that the order to run them is obvious and then call each 
of them using the `source()` function. This way you can create a file called `main.R` 
that you can configure to run all of your analysis from one file. An example of 
a `main.R` file might look like this: 

```{r main-example, eval=FALSE}
# set runtime options and load packages ------------------------------

options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE, scipen = 99)

suppressMessages(library(here)) # to manage file paths
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse)) # to process data

# load R scripts that contains variables and functions for the analysis
source(here::here("byob-study", "R", "globals.R"))
source(here::here("byob-study", "R", "helpers.R"))

# create a folder for storing the output of the analysis from today
# this way your output doesn't accidentally get overwritten from another time
todays_date_formatted <- format(Sys.Date(), '%Y%m%d')
dir.create(here::here('output', todays_date_formatted), showWarnings = FALSE)

# sourcing scripts to run analysis -----------------------------------

source(here::here('01-wrangle.R'))
source(here::here('02-model.R'))
```

### Caching

Sometimes your project will involve a very large dataset or a sequence of complex and 
long-running processing steps. "Caching" is a term for saving off your analysis 
mid-way through the process so that you can restart it exactly from that particular 
spot. R Markdown documents have this built into them, but you can also do this from 
any R script by using the package **simpleCache**. **simpleCache** was created at 
the University of Virginia in part by the UVA R Users Group leader, VP (Pete) Nagraj.
Below is an example that uses a simulation to show how the standard error is calculated. 
The value is stored in the variable `std_error`. The caching process will check the 
`cache` folder and if the object exists, then that block of code is not run and 
the cached output is loaded from the cache folder. If the cached object is not found, 
then the code runs, creates the object, and saves it to the cache folder.
 
```{r cache-example, eval=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(here))  # for file management
suppressMessages(library(simpleCache)) # for caching long running parts of the script 

# set the cache directory
setCacheDir(here::here('cache'))
# delete the files if you want to refresh the cache or run `deleteCaches()` 

# the mean of 1000 standard normal observations has a standard deviation 
# that should approach 1/sqrt(1000) = 0.0316
simpleCache("std_error", {
  n_sample_avgs <- numeric(100)
  for(i in 1:100){
    n_sample_avgs[i] <- mean(rnorm(1000, 0, 1))
  }
  sd(n_sample_avgs)
})
```

## GitHub + Git flow

Once you have worked hard on creating a project in R you typically want to do 2 things: 
1) Backup the work you've done and 2) Share it with others. GitHub is the de facto place 
to accomplish both of these tasks. 

 - Pull from Git Scenarios Talk (walk through examples?)
