## What is an API

An <u><b>A</b></u>pplication <u><b>P</b></u>rogramming <u><b>I</b></u>nterface
is just an abstraction from a lower level process. Think of this as a black box
where you just need to provide some formatted input and you'll get back some
formatted output without any need to understand how things are being done.

  <img src="./img/black-box.png" />
</center>

Today, we'll be discussing web-based data APIs. They abstract away the data
being stored in a database, so that you can access the data without needing to
get access to the database or write ad-hoc queries. Web-based data APIs come in
two flavors (SOAP and REST), which we'll discuss next.

</center><br>

## What makes a SOAP API?

SOAP stands for <u><b>S</b></u>imple <u><b>O</b></u>bject <u><b>A</b></u>ccess <u><b>P</b></u>rotocol.  

It turns out that SOAP APIs can function on multiple computer protocols (HTTP,
SMTP, TCP, or JMS). This means that SOAP APIs don't need to function over the
web, which is just one easy way to transmit information to people.

SOAP APIs are almost always written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and
instructions that describe how you can use SOAP APIs are almost always provided
in a WSDL (Web Service Description Language). Below is a snapshot of the
Salesforce API and how it defines a "PermissionSet" object.

  <img src="./img/salesforce-wsdl.png" />
</center>  

As you can see, this code is pretty complicated and hard to read. On the other
hand, it is very specific about how to define objects and work with them in the
API. For this reason, XML is more secure, ACID-compliant, and all-around more
durable despite being harder to work with.

## What makes a REST API?

REST stands for <u><b>RE</b></u>presentational <u><b>S</b></u>tate
<u><b>T</b></u>ransfer.

REST uses the Verb-Noun Paradigm where operations map exactly to HTTP protocol
actions like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` and the collections of data are
nouns. For example, in the Square API you would GET (verb) a customer (noun).

REST APIs are almost always JSON (Javascript Object Notation) where the
instructions are provided on a web document (typically Swagger UI style) that
you can read and format. The data types are not as strict as a SOAP API. Below
is a snapshot of the Square API. You can see that it's much simpler to read than
the Salesforce SOAP API shown above.

## Working with XML and JSON

It is important to know whether an API is SOAP or REST because, as mentioned,
they are linked to processing and returning either XML or JSON. Unfortunately,
in R there are a number of competing packages that help handle each format. I
recommend trying the **xml2** and **jsonlite** packages first. These are both
part of the tidyverse. However, sometimes you may find that the **XML**,
**rjson**, or **RJSONIO** packages provide unique functionality that is better
for your use case.

Let's consider a tangible example of these two formats, one after the other. For
this purpose, imagine that you are working with customer data. Here's what a
single customer record might look like in each API format.

**SOAP API (XML)**
```{r xml-record-example, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
XML::newXMLNode("customer",
                XML::newXMLNode("first_name", "Elon"),
                XML::newXMLNode("last_name", "Musk"),
                XML::newXMLNode("occupation", "Genius")
                )
```

**REST API (JSON)**
```{r json-record-example, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cust_record <- list(customer = list(first_name = "Elon", 
                                    last_name = "Musk", 
                                    occupation = "Genius"))
jsonlite::toJSON(cust_record, pretty = TRUE, auto_unbox = TRUE)
```

# Getting started in R

Above we mentioned two packages **xml2** and **jsonlite**. These packages will
parse API data from XML or JSON to a `list` or `data.frame`. However, we must be
able to communicate with the server to even get the data in the first place.
This HTTP communication can be done using the **httr** package. Along with the
`httr` package it is helpful to load the rest of the **tidyverse**, which
contains the **dplyr**, **tidyr**, and **purrr** packages that will aid in
further processing the data into a tidy format.

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(xml2)
library(jsonlite)
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
```

## How to authenticate to an API

APIs almost always require authenticating, because the authentication process
protects an API's data and because creators usually want to track and limit
requests accordingly. There are three common types of authentication:

 1. Basic Authentication: You send over your username and password
 2. API Key Authentication: You send over a long key or token in the URL or the
 Header
 3. OAuth 2.0 Authentication: You authorize a client to interact with your level
 of permissions

**Basic Authentication**

```{r basic-auth, eval = FALSE}
response <- GET("http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd", 
                authenticate("user", "passwd"))
content(response, as = "parsed")
```

*API Key Authentication**

```{r api-key-auth, eval = FALSE}
# Square API list locations with authentication provided in the header
GET("https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations", 
    add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", 
                                        "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))

# Open Movie Database movie search by title with the authentication provided in
# the URL
GET(paste0('https://www.omdbapi.com/',
           '?t=The+Godfather&plot=short&apikey=4439909d'))
```

**Note**: Username/Password and Key-based authentication is only considered
secure if used together with other security mechanisms, such as HTTPS/SSL.
Otherwise, people who snoop and grab your internet traffic could see in
plain-text what your credentials are and then turn around to use them
themselves.

**OAuth 2.0 Authentication**

This is the most complex and secure method of authentication. It consists of
multiple parts, namely:

 - An `Authorization URL`, where you send your request initially
 - A `Token URL`, where you get your token initially
 - A `Refresh URL`, where you'll get a new token after your current token
 expires
 - `Scopes`, a list of resources that clients can access given the credentials
 they supply
 
Fortunately, R takes care of all of this, so long as you create a "client" in R. 

```{r oauth2-auth, eval = FALSE}
sq_oauth_app <- oauth_app(
  "square",
  key = app_id, 
  secret = app_secret,
  redirect_uri = callback_url
)

sq_oauth_endpoints <- oauth_endpoint(
  request = NULL,
  base_url = sprintf("%s/oauth2",
                     "https://connect.squareup.com"),
  authorize = "authorize", 
  access = "token", 
  revoke = "revoke"
)

sq_token <- oauth2.0_token(
  endpoint = sq_oauth_endpoints,
  app = sq_oauth_app, 
  cache = cache
)

GET("https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations", 
    config(token = sq_token))
```

## Keeping your credentials hidden in .Rprofile

In the API Key Authentication example above, I put my token in the script like
this:

```{r exposed-token, eval=FALSE}
GET("https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations", 
    add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))
```

This is not really secure because anybody with this script can now pretend to be
me. As an alternative, you can have R store your passwords and other sensitive
information outside of your script to keep it hidden. Follow the steps below to
keep the Square API token hidden on your computer in a way that will allow also
you to still be able to reference it in future scripts.

The concept we're going to apply for this purpose involves environment variables
in R. The R manual provides some detail about how and where environment
variables can be stored:

> R searches for a user profile, a file of R code. The path of this file can be 
> specified by the R_PROFILE_USER environment variable (and tilde expansion will 
> be performed). If this is unset, a file called ‘.Rprofile’ is searched for in 
> the current directory or in the user's home directory (in that order). The user 
> profile file is sourced into the workspace.

The first step is figuring out your HOME directory. You can do this by running the 
following command in R: 

```{r checking-home-directory}
# create the .Rprofile file at this location if it doesn't already exist
Sys.getenv("HOME")
```

### Enabling the Viewing of Hidden Files

The .Rprofile file is a "hidden" file because it starts with a period. For this reason 
you may need to enable "Hidden Files" in your File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) in 
order for it to show up in your folders. To do this on Mac you need to open up the terminal and type: 

```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
```

Finally relaunch Finder by using holding the Option key, then right clicking on the 
Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch. 

### Adding your credentials to .Rprofile

Open up the .Rprofile file, add the following lines, and save it.

```
options(scipen=99, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
Sys.setenv(SQUARE_PAT = "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")
```
**NOTE**: Ensure that there is a new line at the end of your file so that the 
second command runs!

### Checking your .Rprofile settings

Now that you've saved your token in you'll need to restart R. This is because R 
reads the `.Rprofile` everytime you start R, so the restart forces the file to be 
loaded again. You can restart R by going to `Session -> Restart R` or using the 
shortcut `CMD+SHIFT+F10` (`CRTL+SHIFT+F10` on Windows). You can check that the token 
now exists by running: 

```{r check-token}
Sys.getenv('SQUARE_PAT')
```

## Becoming familiar with HTTP status codes

Before you get started making API calls, it is important to understand various messages 
that the API will return. HTTP status codes follow a pattern so that, at a glance, 
understand where the error happened. After that there is usually an "error code" and 
"error detail" that more fully describes why that error occurred. Here are the ranges 
of codes and what they mean:

 - 2XX: Success!
 - 4XX: Your fault!
 - 5XX: Their fault!

Here is an example where I wasn't authenticated before making the API call. It's 
a 401 error, that's my fault.

```{r no-password-error}
response <- GET("https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations")
response
content(response, as='parsed')
```

Again, here is the right way to provide authentication to the call:

```{r with-password, eval=FALSE}
GET("https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations",
    add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))
```

Here is an example where I didn't get the URL correct. I forgot to include the "s" 
to spell "locations" not "location" as the endpoint.

```{r wrong-url}
response <- GET("https://connect.squareup.com/v2/location")
response
content(response, as='parsed')
```

There are about 40 status codes. Here are tips on how to handle the most common codes you'll see:

 - 200: Success: Jump for joy, everything was processed successfully
 - 401: Unauthenticated: Make sure you're sending your password or token correctly
 - 404: Not Found: Make sure the URL you're sending to is the right one
 - 500: Server Error: Double check you're formatting the request correctly

## Anatomy of API calls (scheme, hostname, path, query, and body)

Every API call can be broken down into a few different elements. See this example 
where we can create a new customer record 

 - **Scheme**: http or https
 - **Hostname**: connect.squareup.com
 - **Path**: v2/customers
 - **Query**: ?key1=value1&key2=value2
 - **Body**: `{'given_name'='Bob', 'family_name'='Miller', 'note'='API Test'}`

Putting his all together you want to make a request like this:

```
POST https://connect.squareup.com/v2/customers
Authorization: Bearer sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6
{
  "given_name": "Bob",
  "family_name": "Miller",
  "note": "API Test"
}
```

Here is how to replicate that from R: 

```{r example-POST, eval=FALSE}
response <- POST('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/customers', 
                 add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")),
                 body = list(given_name='Bob', 
                             family_name='Miller', 
                             note='API Test'), 
                 encode='json')
status_code(response)
content(response, as='parsed')
```

In the example above we didn't show how the "query" component fits in. A query is information 
added at the end of the "path" component to control the behavior. It's always represented 
as a series of key, value pairs after a question mark in the URL. Here is an example where 
we pull all the transactions for the Corner location between October 5th and 6th and 
ensure that they are returned in descending order.

```{r example-with-query-param}
response <- GET(paste0('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations/1AWPRVVVFWGQF/transactions',
                       '?begin_time=2018-10-05T00:00:00Z&end_time=2018-10-06T00:00:00Z&sort_order=DESC'),
                add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))
response
```

As you can see the URL can get very long and complicated. The `httr` package has 
a function called `build_url()` that makes it easier to construct the right URL 
from a bunch of component parts. Here is an example where we use the `build_url()` 
function to create our request URL.

```{r example-using-build-url}
url <- parse_url("http://connect.squareup.com")
url$scheme <- "https"
url$path <- "v2/locations/1AWPRVVVFWGQF/transactions"
url$query <- list(begin_time = "2018-10-05T00:00:00Z", 
                  end_time = "2018-10-06T00:00:00Z",
                  sort_order = "DESC")
this_url <- build_url(url)
this_url
```

You'll notice here that colon (`:`) character was "escaped" with `%3A`. This is because 
certain characters are reserved and can be mistaken as part of the URL path, so the 
`build_url()` function safely handles these by encoding them. This is a handy way to avoid 
mistakes in forming the URL.

## HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

In the last example you saw that I used two different functions, the `POST()` function and 
then the `GET()` function. This is because I wanted to do different types of things. 
In the first example I wanted to "post" the new customer data to the API server. In the 
second, I wanted to "get" the customer data.

The takeaway is always keep in mind what type of operation you are trying to do. If you are trying 
to create or update a record, you most likely won't be using the `GET()` function. Using the wrong 
HTTP verb is an error that can sometimes be hard to debug and is easy to avoid. This table 
summarizes the basic type of behavior you want to do and the associated verb.

Verb | Behavior | Has Body?
-----|----------|:---------:
GET | Read Data | ✗
POST | Create/Read Data | ✓
PUT/PATCH | Update Data | ✓
DELETE | Delete Data | ✗

Below is a screenshot of the API documentation where they make it very clear what 
type of HTTP request you should be using if you want to create a customer in contrast 
to just listing customers.

# Using the Square APIs (Connect v1 & v2)

Square has developed two different APIs (Connect [v1](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/connect/v1) & 
[v2](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/connect/v2)) that are organized to have endpoints 
that each serve a different type of data. For examples, a URL for customers (`v2/customers`), a URL for 
payments (`v1/{location_id}/payments`), a URL for the products you sell (`v1/{location_id}/items`), etc. 
This way you can easily find the type of data you're looking for. 

## The role of locations in the Square API

The Square API stores a lot of information. It is likely that they have a database 
that is "partitioned" by location so that whenever a new request comes in they can 
quickly pull the data by navigating directly to that location's partion and then pulling the data 
based on the request. You'll see that certain endpoints require you to specify the location. 
Here is an example for the transactions: 

`GET /v2/locations/{location_id}/transactions`  

So how do you get the location IDs? Use the `ListLocations` endpoint. Here is how to 
gather the information for every location: 

```{r list-locations}
response <- GET('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations',
                add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))
map_df(content(response, as='parsed')$locations, 
       .f=function(x){
         tibble(id = x$id, 
                location_name = x$name)
       })
```

## Pulling transactions

Now that we know The Corner location has ID `1AWPRVVVFWGQF` we can use it to pull all 
the recent transactions. 

```{r list-corner-transactions}
response <- GET(paste0('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/locations/1AWPRVVVFWGQF/transactions',
                       '?begin_time=2018-10-05T00:00:00Z&end_time=2018-10-06T00:00:00Z&sort_order=DESC'),
                add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))

all_transactions <- content(response, as='parsed')$transactions %>%
  map_df(~as_tibble(modify_if(., ~(length(.x) > 1 | is.list(.x)), list)))

all_transactions
```

The transaction literally only represents a location and timestamp when a transaction 
occurred. The "tender" where money was exchanged is included inside the "tenders" field: 

```{r show-tenders-field}
all_transactions$tenders[1]
```

## Pulling order itemizations

In the example above we saw that the transaction data only provides the gross revenue 
for the transaction and the customer ID. If we want to know more about each customer 
order, then we need to use the `Payments` endpoint.

```{r payments-example}
response <- GET(paste0('https://connect.squareup.com/v1/1AWPRVVVFWGQF/payments',
                       '?begin_time=2018-10-05T00:00:00Z&end_time=2018-10-06T00:00:00Z'),
                add_headers(Authorization = sprintf("Bearer %s", "sq0atp-PQdK9iw65pOwQgTQXtQt6")))

all_payments <- content(response, as='parsed') %>%
  map_df(~as_tibble(modify_if(., ~(length(.x) > 1 | is.list(.x)), list)))

head(all_payments$itemizations[1][[1]][[1]], 4)
```

## Using the squareupr package

Pulling API data in R is definitely a time consuming process. You have to check the 
documentation, fiddle with the R code to reproduce the HTTP call, then parse the output 
into a tidy format. For this reason, R users typically create packages that simplify 
your workflow and cut out all the processing and guesswork. This is the reason for 
creating the **squareupr** package. In order to start using the package you must 
first install it from GitHub like this: 

```{r squareupr-install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('StevenMMortimer/squareupr')
```

And before using the package you need to load it and supply it with your Square API 
token so that all of the API calls are authenticated properly.

```{r squareupr-load}
library(squareupr)
sq_auth(Sys.getenv('SQUARE_PAT'))
```

Now that the pacakge is loaded you can pull transaction data is like this:

```{r pulling-transaction-data}
our_locations <- sq_list_locations()
yesterdays_transactions <- sq_list_transactions("The Corner (C'ville)")
yesterdays_transactions
```

Or pulling customers from the last 90 days can be done like this
```{r squareupr-search-customers}
created_start <- format(Sys.Date()-90, '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00-00:00')
created_end <- format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00-00:00')
our_customers <- sq_search_customers(query = list(filter=
                                                    list(created_at=
                                                           list(start_at=created_start,
                                                                end_at=created_end))))
our_customers$given_name <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_customers$family_name <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_customers %>% select(id, created_at, updated_at, 
                         given_name, family_name, preferences, groups)
```

And if you'd like to get the assigned groups there is a function called `sq_extract_cust_groups()` 
to do that. This is an example of having "helper" functions that continue to process 
down the API data into a tidy format so that we all can do analyses faster and easier.

```{r squareupr-extract-cust-groups}
sq_extract_cust_groups(our_customers)
```

## The performance of the API

It takes 70 seconds to get a month's worth of transaction data from the Corner location, 
then it takes another 75 seconds to get the payment data to breakdown each transaction's items. 
Furthermore, it takes a few minutes to take the JSON and convert it into a tidy format. 
You can see that the time starts to become a barrier to actually doing data analysis. For 
this reason we've started pulling down the API data and using that instead of using 
the API directly. All of that data is being stored here:

https://github.com/sustainablecommerce/the-juice-laundry/tree/master/data

## Next steps

Our analyses of Square data will require more functions and storing more data. Every step 
towards making a data flow reproducible and tidy will reduce mistakes and the time to 
analyze later. So if you come up with a function to do something useful consider 
adding it to the package or our library to leverage again later.
